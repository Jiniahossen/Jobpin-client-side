                    <p className=" text-lg font-serif">Access tokens and refresh tokens are both types of OAuth tokens that are used to authenticate users and authorize access to protected resources. However, they have different purposes and lifespans.

                        Access tokens are short-lived tokens that are used to grant an application access to a users resources on a specific resource server. They typically have a lifespan of a few hours or minutes. Once an access token expires, it cannot be used to access protected resources.

                        Refresh tokens are long-lived tokens that are used to obtain new access tokens. They typically have a lifespan of several days or weeks. When an access token expires, the client application can use the refresh token to request a new access token from the authorization server.

                        Where to Store Access Tokens and Refresh Tokens

                        Access tokens and refresh tokens should be stored securely on the client-side to prevent unauthorized access. However, the exact location of where to store them will depend on the specific application and its security requirements.

                        Here are some general guidelines for storing access tokens and refresh tokens:

                        Do not store access tokens in browser cookies. Browser cookies are not secure and can be easily stolen by attackers.
                        Do not store access tokens in localStorage. LocalStorage is slightly more secure than browser cookies, but it is still not recommended for storing sensitive information.
                        Store access tokens in a secure storage mechanism, such as the Keychain or Secure Enclave. These mechanisms are more secure and can help to protect access tokens from unauthorized access.
                        Refresh tokens should also be stored securely. However, they can be stored less securely than access tokens because they are not used to directly access protected resources.

                        Here are some general guidelines for storing refresh tokens:

                        Do not store refresh tokens in browser cookies or localStorage.
                        Store refresh tokens in a secure storage mechanism, such as the Keychain or Secure Enclave.
                        Consider encrypting refresh tokens before storing them. This will add an additional layer of security.
                        Additional Security Considerations

                        Always send access tokens over an HTTPS connection to prevent eavesdropping.
                        Include the scope of the requested access token when making API requests. This will help to limit the amount of access that the application has to the users resources.
                        Revoke access tokens when they are no longer needed. This can help to prevent unauthorized access to protected resources.
                        By following these guidelines, you can help to protect access tokens and refresh tokens from unauthorized access and ensure the security of your application.</p>

                    <p className=" text-lg font-serif">Express.js is a popular and minimal web application framework for Node.js. It is an unopinionated framework, meaning that it does not impose a specific structure or way of doing things on developers. This gives developers a lot of flexibility in how they design and build their applications.

                        Express.js is built on top of the Node.js HTTP module, and it provides a simple API for creating and routing HTTP requests. It also provides a number of middleware functions that can be used to add functionality to applications, such as logging, parsing JSON data, and authentication.

                        Key features of Express.js:

                        Unopinionated framework
                        Minimal and lightweight
                        Easy to learn and use
                        Large and active community
                        Supports a wide variety of middleware
                        NestJS

                        NestJS is a progressive, TypeScript-based web application framework built on top of Express.js. It is an opinionated framework, meaning that it provides a more structured and opinionated way of building applications. This can make it easier for developers to get started and to maintain consistent code across their applications.

                        NestJS uses a modular architecture, and it provides a number of features to help developers build scalable and maintainable applications, such as dependency injection, decorators, and modules.
